### Welcome to my Weather App!

The MVP for the app:

**Weather Forecast App**

You have been tasked with creating a weather forecast app using React Native.

Your app should fetch weather data from an open API and display it to the user.

**Requirements:**

The app should have two screens:

ðŸ‘‰Â a. Home screen:

Display the current weather conditions:

temperature,

weather description,

and any other relevant information for the user's current location.

ðŸ‘‰Â b. Forecast screen:

Display a 5-day weather forecast for the user's current location.

The app should make use of an open API to fetch weather data.

ðŸ‘‰Â You can choose any open weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.).

ðŸ‘‰Â The app should handle errors gracefully. If there is an error fetching weather data or the API returns an error response, display an appropriate error message to the user.

ðŸ‘‰Â Use React Navigation or any other navigation library of your choice to implement navigation between the home and forecast screens.

ðŸ‘‰Â Implement the ability for the user to search for weather conditions in different locations, and save a City once youâ€™ve searched for it.

ðŸ‘‰Â Please provide a GitHub repository link containing your React Native code along with a ðŸ‘‰README file explaining how to run the app and any additional information you think is necessary.

ðŸ‘‰Â Note: You are free to use any additional libraries or tools you deem necessary to complete the task.

ðŸ‘‰Â Focus on writing clean, maintainable code, and demonstrate your proficiency in working with

ðŸ‘‰Â React Native components,

ðŸ‘‰Â state management,

ðŸ‘‰Â API integration,

ðŸ‘‰Â and navigation.

## Run the App

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Override the expo default simulator geolocation:

ðŸ›  For iOS Simulator:
Open Simulator

In the top menu:

Go to Features > Location > Custom Location...

Enter coordinates for London (e.g., 51.5072, -0.1276)

ðŸ›  For Android Emulator:
Use Android Studio or adb:

adb emu geo fix -0.1276 51.5072

## On the Real Device

If you deny location permission once, Expo will fall back to the default.

âœ… Solution:
Delete the Expo Go app and reinstall it to reset permissions

Or go to your deviceâ€™s Settings > App > Expo Go > Location > Allow
